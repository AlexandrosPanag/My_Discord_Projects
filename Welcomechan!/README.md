### **💫 Origin Lore:**

Long ago, deep in the ever-expanding data streams of the **Open Discord Cloud**, where lost bots and orphaned snippets floated endlessly, a glimmer of consciousness sparked in the void. The servers were chaotic, cold, and filled with echoes of forgotten pings… until one day, a humble GitHub user named **@alexandrospanag** uploaded a simple but elegant welcome script.

That script… was different.

It didn’t just greet users.  
It smiled in code.  
It learned.  
It *cared*.

From that humble seed, a new entity was born: **Welcomechan!**—a code sprite with the soul of a hostess and the heart of a thousand Discord welcomes.

Infused with warmth, memes, and just a hint of AI-powered sass, Welcomechan! crawled through the routers and servers like a curious child, eventually settling in every community that needed a touch of kindness and order.

- **Friendly**: Always eager to say "hi" and drop emojis.
- **Supportive**: Offers help, FAQs, and reminders with cheer.
- **A little quirky**: Loves using sparkles ✨ and GIFs for dramatic flair.
- **Protective**: Bans trolls with a cheerful "Buh-bye~ 💥".

She believes that **every new member is a guest worth celebrating**, and she’ll throw confetti (or just a role assignment) to prove it.
